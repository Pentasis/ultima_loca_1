1.2
- only change temperate climate for snow caps. Before desert/tropical were also affected.
- Added option for 'winding' rivers (zig-zag).
- Change default for mountain density to 'medium'
- Improved mountain-ridge tree densities.
- Improved snow layer
- Bugfix: error on random number when river is set to minimum
- Fixed: rocks didn't render when trees were set to 0. # of rocks is still lower (maxSlope is set for both trees & rocks in vanilla, I need to find a solution for this).

1.3
- Changed how mountain density is calculated
- Added the ability to change the mountain ridge curvature
- Removed minimum height of mountains (now set to 150 by default)
- Even wider rivers (this is the maximum before deformation occurs)
- More chance of branching rivers
- Changed some buttons to checkboxes (for UX and space)
- Changed name of mod
