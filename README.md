# Ultima Loca

This generator will create well-defined mountain ranges with very flat areas inbetween.

It is still WIP but functional and safe to use.

The reason I made this was because I found the vanilla generator and other modded generators didn't create very scenic maps because the transitions between highland and lowland was too gradual & 'bumpy' for my taste. Also, I wanted to have more control over rivers; especially their widths.

## Mountains
- Higher mountains (upto about 1100m) with a more distinct transition between flatland and mountain ranges.
- If you enable snow tops in the mod settings (on by default) mountain tops will be covered in snow above ~750m.

## Rivers
- Rivers can be much narrower and wider than in vanilla. (Keep in mind that ships cannot navigate very narrow rivers.)
- Wider rivers are also deeper (still experimenting with this).
- Lake generation in rivers can be disabled.
- More rivers.
- Curved rivers.
- Random river widths (still experimenting with this).

## Rocks
- Option to disable scattered rocks on the map; completely or keep them along rivers.

## Trees & Forests
- Amount of scattered forests can be set (tree density).
- Tree density also affects the density of forests along mountain ridges, but in a limited way only. When set to 0 no trees will generate at all.
- The treeline (height) on mountains can be changed.

### TODO:
- Option to add a coastline?
- Scattered lakes (outside rivers)?
- Translations
- Finetuning (mountain height-density ratio, river depth & width randomness)
