[h1]Not so Temperate Generator[/h1]

This generator creates mixed(!) narrower & wider rivers and well-defined mountain ranges with very flat areas inbetween.

It is still WIP but functional and safe to use (lots more options and tweaks still to come).

The reason I made this was because I found the vanilla generator and other modded generators didn't create very scenic and practical maps because the transitions between highland and lowland was too gradual & 'bumpy' for my taste. Also, I wanted to have more control over rivers; especially their widths.

[h2]New Features & Changes[/h2]
[list]
[*]Winding rivers (v1.2)
[*]Somewhat better mountain-density calculation*
[*]Mountain ridge curvature (v1.3)
[*]Removed minimum mountain height (now fixed at 150m)
[*]Wider rivers than before (v1.3). I cannot make them wider than this because they will deform.
[*]Bigger chance of (more) branching rivers.
[*]Changed the name of the mod.
[/list]

*)Density is a tough setting to control. As mountains get higher, density goes up by default so I bring it down again. But there seems to be some sort of exponential factor involved I haven't figured out yet. Let me know in the comments if you are happy with how density works now.

[h2]Mountains[/h2]
[list]
[*]Higher mountains (upto about 1500m) with a more distinct transition between flatland and cliffs.
[*]If you enable snow tops in the mod settings (on by default) mountain tops will be covered in snow above ~750m.
[*]Change mountain range curvature.
[/list]

[h2]Rivers[/h2]
[list]
[*]Rivers can be much narrower and wider than in vanilla. (Keep in mind that ships cannot navigate very narrow rivers.)
[*]Wider rivers are also deeper.
[*]Lake generation in rivers can be disabled.
[*]More rivers.
[*]Curved rivers.
[*]Random river widths.
[*]Winding (zig-zag) rivers. These seem to work best when river-curvature is set somewhere in the middle.
[/list]

[h2]Rocks[/h2]
[list]
[*]Option to disable scattered rocks on the map; completely or keep them along rivers.
[/list]

[h2]Trees & Forests[/h2]
[list]
[*]Amount of scattered forests can be set (forest density does not affect lone trees).
[*]Forest density also affects the density of forests along mountain ridges.
[*]When set to 0, no trees will generate at all.
[*]The treeline (height) on mountains can be controlled.
[/list]

[h2]TODO:[/h2]
[list]
[*]Option to add a coastline?
[*]Scattered lakes (outside rivers)?
[*]Translations
[*]Mod option for more rock textures?
[/list]

[h2]Important[/h2]
If you enable the snow caps option, they will also appear in the (temperate) vanilla generator and any other modded generator that uses the temperate climate.
